# This file lays out networking for our environments
#
# To be able to support network peering we have to
# have environemnts who's base vnet's don't overlap

# Azure allows the following network ranges
# 1. "10.0.0.0/8" <- this will be used by our main applications
# 2. "172.16.0.0/12" <- this will be used by integration stacks, such as ipsec tunnel
# 3. "192.168.0.0/16" <- ATM not allocated
